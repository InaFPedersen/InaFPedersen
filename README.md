Hello, I'm Ina F. Pedersen

I'm interested in different areas of coding, such as developing and designing educational games, or games in general. 
I'm also interested in creating applications and system development.

This far I have tried programming in:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- C#
- Vue
- React
- Angular
- TypeScript
- .NET

And I'm still a junior in all of these programming languages.
